# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images, which are categorized into two classes: **Healthy** and **Tumor**. The goal is to build a reliable model that can assist in diagnosing brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is organized into two main directories:

- **Training**
  - Contains images for training the model, with subdirectories for each class (Healthy and Tumor).
- **Validation**
  - Contains images for validating the model performance, with the same subdirectory structure.

### Dataset Structure

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred IDE or Google Colab.

Run the training process to train the CNN model using the training dataset.

After training, you can use the model to make predictions on new MRI images.

To predict, upload a random image from the validation set or provide your own image. The model will classify it as either Tumor Detected or No Tumor Detected.

Example Prediction
The model provides the following output for predictions:

Prediction: Tumor Detected - If the model predicts a tumor in the MRI scan.
Prediction: No Tumor Detected - If the model predicts the absence of a tumor.
Results
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix. You can visualize the training history to analyze the model's performance over epochs.
